         Get binaries from source:
         -------------------------
  
         -> cd <MiMPI directory>
  
            Go to MiMPI base directory.
  
         -> vi configure.in

            [ OPTIONAL ] Add or change any option you wish.
  
         -> autoconf

            Command to use in order to generate "configure" script.
  
         -> ./configure
  
            Use Autoconf in order to guess your system and generates
            Makefiles.
  
         -> make
  
            Compile MiMPI as a library ( lib/libmpi.a ),
            a daemon needed to run ( bin/ns.exe ) and some
            examples ( example/* )
  

         Install binaries into system:
         -----------------------------
  
         -> cp lib/libmpi.a     <system library path>
            cp include/mpi.h    <system includes path>
            cp bin/ns.exe       <system binary path>
  
            System library path are usally /lib or /usr/lib.
            System includes path is /usr/include and
            System binary path can be /bin or /usr/bin.
  
  
         Some test for MiMPI:
         --------------------
  
          -> cd test
        
             Go to test directory.
        
          -> make
        
             Compile many test. Some plataforms miss
             some option.
